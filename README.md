## üöÄ Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models used primarily for analyzing visual data. 
They have gained significant popularity in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation due to their ability to automatically detect important features in images.

This repository demonstrates several implementations of CNN architectures, including binary image classification, transfer learning, autoencoders, and more.

### Key Implementations:

- **Image Classifier**: Implement a CNN for binary image classification (e.g., Cats vs Dogs).
- **Transfer Learning with Fine Tuning**: Apply transfer learning with fine-tuning for improving model performance on new tasks.
- **Autoencoder**: Implement an autoencoder, which learns efficient codings of data for tasks like anomaly detection and denoising.
- **LSTM Implementation**: Combine CNNs with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction.
- **Vector Addition with TensorFlow**: A simple example demonstrating vector addition using TensorFlow.
