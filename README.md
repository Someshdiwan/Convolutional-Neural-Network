## 🚀 Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models used primarily for analyzing visual data. 
They have gained significant popularity in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation due to their ability to automatically detect important features in images.
